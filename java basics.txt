public private and protected class declarations
In Java, access modifiers are used to control the visibility of class members such as variables and methods. There are three access modifiers in Java: public, private, and protected.

Public:
Public members can be accessed from anywhere, including other classes, even if they are in a different package. Here is an example of a public class declaration:
csharp
Copy code
public class MyClass {
   public int myPublicVar;
   
   public void myPublicMethod() {
      // method code here
   }
}
In this example, the "MyClass" class has a public instance variable "myPublicVar" and a public instance method "myPublicMethod". These members can be accessed from anywhere in the code.

Private:
Private members can only be accessed within the same class. Here is an example of a private class declaration:
csharp
Copy code
public class MyClass {
   private int myPrivateVar;
   
   private void myPrivateMethod() {
      // method code here
   }
}
In this example, the "MyClass" class has a private instance variable "myPrivateVar" and a private instance method "myPrivateMethod". These members can only be accessed within the "MyClass" class.

Protected:
Protected members can be accessed within the same class, subclass, or within the same package. Here is an example of a protected class declaration:
csharp
Copy code
public class MyClass {
   protected int myProtectedVar;
   
   protected void myProtectedMethod() {
      // method code here
   }
}
In this example, the "MyClass" class has a protected instance variable "myProtectedVar" and a protected instance method "myProtectedMethod". These members can be accessed within the "MyClass" class, any subclass of "MyClass", or any class within the same package as "MyClass".
